Ongoing Research Projects

-   **Cross corelation between GL and SZ maps to constraint Cosmological
    parameters**

    *Supervisor: Subhabrata Majumdar*

    *TIFR, Mumbai* ***Aug 2018- Present***

    This work is an extension of my work from my master's thesis.
    The work involves understanding statistical analysis of data from a
    cosmology perspective. It also involves using libraries such as
    HealPy, PyFITS to manipulate the data. 
    During my master's thesis, I was able to compute the cross correlation from various galaxy surveys.
    Currently I am trying to use the theory of Halo models to constraint various cosmological and astrophysical
    parameters using these cross-correlations.


-   **Turbulence in ICM using tSZ maps**

    *Along with: Rishi Khatri*

    *TIFR, Mumbai* ***Jan 2020- Present***

    We try to probe turbulence around the virgo cluster by using tSZ maps. 
    

-   **Component seperation from Planck skymaps using unsupervised machine learning**

    *Along with: Rishi Khatri*

    *TIFR, Mumbai* ***Feb 2019- Present***

    This work was part of my master's thesis during my time at TIFR. This work involves using unsupervised
    clustering techniques to perform component seperation on Planck skymaps to extract tSZ maps.

Past Research Projects

-   **Using Neural Networks to detect non-Gaussianities in the CMB**

    *Along with: Tuhin S Roy, Rishi Khatri*

    *TIFR, Mumbai* ***Dec 2018- Feb 2018***

    This work tried to use neural network to
    detect non-Gaussianities in the CMB Sky map. The work involves
    finding novel methods to use neural networks on a spherical
    manifold. We moved on to a different project involving machine learning pretty soon.
    I would like to get back to this soon.

-   **Estimation of the mass gap in modified SYK hamiltonians**

    *Supervisor: Gautam Mandal*

    *TIFR, Mumbai* ***Aug 2018- Jan 2019***

    Worked on numerically estimating the massgap in Modified SYK
    hamiltonians. The work involved understanding the conformal limit in
    the SYK model and analytically computing the massgap in the
    conformal limit and numerically trying to compute the eigenvalues of
    large dimensional matrices to get as close to the conformal limit as
    possible.

-   **Quark gluon discrimination using Deep Neural Networks**

    *Supervisor: Tuhin S Roy*

    *TIFR, Mumbai* ***Aug 2017- Jan 2018***

    Worked on building a convolutional neural network classifier to
    classify the quark jets from the gluon jets in particle
    accelerators. The work involved understanding the basics of neural
    networks and machine learning, build it using Tensorflow, make
    simulations of particle accelerators using Pythia, jet clustering
    using FastJet and understanding certain physics observables to
    classify jets the conventional way.

-   **Rigidity percolation in wet granular systems**

    *Supervisor: Purusattam Ray*

    *Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc), Chennai* ***Jun 2015 -
    Aug 2015***

    Worked on understanding rigidity transition by using percolation
    theory and modelling it similar to jamming transition in granular
    systems.
